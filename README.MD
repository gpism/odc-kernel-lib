# ODC Kernel Library

ODC Kernel Library is a core library that provides essential functionalities for all ODC modules. It includes various components, such as Grid computing, meta connector, common data interchange model, dynamic coroutines, security, and file persistence. This library serves as the foundation for building ODC modules and ensures seamless integration between them.

## Core Features

- **Grid Computing:** The library supports grid computing, enabling parallel processing and distributed computation across multiple nodes, improving overall performance and scalability.

- **Meta Connector:** ODC Kernel Library provides a powerful meta connector that allows seamless integration with various data sources, including lambdas, As400, Oracle, Dynamo, Kinesis, and more. It simplifies data retrieval and transformation, making it easy to work with different connectors.

- **Common Data Interchange Model:** The library offers a common data interchange model, ensuring consistency in data representation across different ODC modules. This facilitates smooth data exchange between modules, reducing integration complexities.

- **Dynamic Coroutines:** ODC Kernel Library leverages dynamic coroutines to support reactive programming and asynchronous execution, enhancing the efficiency of processing asynchronous tasks.

- **Security:** Security features are integrated into the library, ensuring secure data handling and access control across ODC modules.

- **File Persistence:** The library provides file persistence capabilities, enabling data storage and retrieval from files efficiently.

## How to Use

To use ODC Kernel Library in your ODC modules, include the library as a dependency in your project's build configuration. For Maven projects, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.opendatacore</groupId>
    <artifactId>kernel</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

For other build systems, refer to their respective documentation to add the ODC Kernel Library dependency.
